### What this is about

This is the second project for the Udacity React Developer Nanodegree.

This project has been developed from a fork of the starter project provided
by Udacity's developers (please refer to file README_original.md).

The API provided with the original project is required by the React application.

Get the application by downloading it from your browser, or by cloning it with Git.

`git clone https://github.com/geocarlos/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git readable`

There are two folders: api-server and frontend.

This will start the API server.

### React application
